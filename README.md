# VeryFirstBlockchainExperience
let's take a little peek into the world of blockchain

The goal here is to make the first steps in Build a Blockchain Application guided by a tutorial for a memory game on the Blockchain.
* we will be using and testing some of the below mentioned components here in the project
* big thanks to https://www.dappuniversity.com and his ethereum-developer-tools-list
### Development

#### Frameworks
* [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com) - Most popular smart contract development, testing, and deployment framework. Often used with [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) (also developed by the Trufle team)

#### IDEs
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Atom editor with [Atom Solidity Linter](https://atom.io/packages/atom-solidity-linter), [Etheratom](https://atom.io/packages/etheratom)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) - Visual Studio Code extension that adds support for Solidity

#### Tools
* [Solc](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html?highlight=bin) - Solidity compiler
* [Sol-compiler](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/v2-prototype/packages/sol-compiler) - Project-level Solidity compiler
* [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium) - Linter to identify and fix style & security issues in Solidity
* [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) - App for test Ethereum blockchain with visual UI and logs

#### Messaging
* [Whisper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper) - Communication protocol for DApps to communicate with each other, a native base layer service of the Ethereum web3 stack
* [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com) - Most popular smart contract development, testing, and deployment framework
**[Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)- App for test Ethereum blockchain with visual UI and logs

#### Wallets
* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) - Chrome extension Ether wallet with ERC tokens support

#### Block explorers
* [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) - Most popular centralised way to view Eth transactions and contract code
* [Etherchain Light](https://github.com/gobitfly/etherchain-light)- Lightweight blockchain explorer for your private Ethereum chain

#### Gas price calculators and tools
* [EthGasStation](https://ethgasstation.info/) - Website for estimating tx prices vs times

#### Testing
* [Solidity code coverage](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/v2-prototype/packages/sol-cov) - Solidity code coverage tool
* [Solidity coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) - Alternative code coverage for Solidity smart-contracts
